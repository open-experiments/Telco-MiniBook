# Modernizing Telco Applications: The Complete Guide

Over the past four years, we have been actively publishing our work on Medium, sharing insights and deep dives into the future of Telco with over 23 episodes of detailed articles. You can check out our Medium Publications [here](https://medium.com/open-5g-hypercore).

## About the Book

This mini-book is a compressed knowhow guide that brings together all our published articles into a single, coherent narrative. Each chapter has been crafted to maintain the depth and clarity of the original content while providing a continuous and engaging storytelling experience. The main theme revolves around how Telco applications can be modernized using:

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**
- **Service Mesh**
- **Data Mesh**
- **OpenTelemetry (OTel)**
- **eBPF**

The book delves into how data from OS, platform, and applications can feed into AI-driven OSS and BSS for platform engineering and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It also addresses how to avoid the pitfalls of AI blindness, ensuring that the AI systems integrated into Telco operations are both robust and reliable.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Kubernetes & Service Mesh**: Learn how these technologies are transforming Telco applications, enabling scalable and resilient infrastructures.
- **Data Mesh & Observability**: Understand the importance of data as a product and how observability with OTel and eBPF can enhance system performance.
- **AI-Driven OSS/BSS**: Discover how AI can be integrated into network operations and business processes, optimizing efficiency and customer experience.
- **Avoiding AI Blindness**: Get insights into the challenges of over-reliance on AI and strategies to maintain critical human oversight.

## How to Access the Book

Each chapter of the book is available as an individual `.txt` file in this repository. You can download and read them at your convenience. If you prefer to have the book as a single document, you can easily compile the chapters into a `.doc` file using your preferred text editor.
